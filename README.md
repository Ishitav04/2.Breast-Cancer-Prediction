# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The project employs a dataset with various features related to breast cancer tumors, aiming to build predictive models for early detection and classification.

# Key Components:
Data Exploration:
In-depth exploration and analysis of the dataset, examining feature distributions, correlations, and insights into the characteristics of benign and malignant tumors.

Data Preprocessing:
Comprehensive data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to enhance the dataset for machine learning model training.

Feature Selection:
Utilizing correlation analysis and other techniques to select relevant features for model training, focusing on those with the most significant impact on the predictive task.

Machine Learning Models:
Implementing machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), to predict breast cancer diagnosis based on the selected features.

Model Evaluation:
Assessing model performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the generation of a confusion matrix.

Data Visualization:
Utilizing Seaborn for visualizations, including pair plots to understand patterns related to the diagnosis variable.
